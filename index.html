   <h3 class="description">I am currently learning *MERN Stack Web Development*</h3>
   <p>This is Imranul Islam, a passionate Civil Engineer from Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Alongside my engineering career, I am currently learning *MERN Stack Web Development* (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) through eShikhon to build a strong freelancing career. My goal is to combine my technical expertise in civil engineering with modern web development skills to explore new opportunities in the tech industry. I am highly motivated, adaptable, and eager to contribute to innovative projects that require problem-solving and creativity. With dedication and continuous learning, I aim to excel in both fields and create a meaningful impact in my professional journey.</p>
